# Hello-world
A tutorial my brother told me to do 

The Harbinger of Timism has created this branch.
Which means there is somthing different here than the master branch, that is until I join this commit to the master branch and then 
I can say that these branchs are now the same branch.
Which basically means that I have done something cool and been able to combine these two things.
